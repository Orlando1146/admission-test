Python source code "question＿one.py" and "question_two.py" are my implementations for Question 1 and Question 2 respectively.

My answers for Question 3 are listed in "question＿three.pdf" and all relevant study notes are organized in the "Study_Notes" folder. My study notes include all Git commands I've learned by now and Python codes for my practice.
